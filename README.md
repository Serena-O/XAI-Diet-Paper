doi:

This contains the scripts used for pre-processing the two datasets: UK Biobank, and HMP2 in R, and also performing metabolomics-based diagnoistic prediction of IBD, apply SHAP XAI and diet-metabolite correlations in Python.

As I am not at liberty to share the UK Biobank data, it has been removed from the data folder (Cohort Data).

Feel free to contact me (serenaonwuka@gmail.com) should you have any queries concerning the codes.
