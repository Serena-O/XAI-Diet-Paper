This repository contains the scripts used for 
- pre-processing the two datasets: UK Biobank, and HMP2 in R (Data Preprocessing.R),
- performing metabolomics-based diagnostic prediction of IBD, applying SHAP XAI and performing diet-metabolite correlations in Python (ML-XAI-Diet.ipynb), and
- performing LASSO regression in R (ClassificationScript for LASSO-R.R, and LASSO-R.R)
